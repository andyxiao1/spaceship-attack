# Spaceship Attack
This is a spaceship shooter game that I made with Java Swing for my CIS 120 final project  
It includes an intro screen, level select, instructions, and highscores   
  
## How to Play
* Move the spaceship (aka the red block) with your arrow keys
* Shoot lasers with the space bar
* Kill enemies (aka blue ovals) by shooting them down
* Collect coins (aka yellow circles)
* Avoid or shoot down asteroids (aka black circles)
* Keep an eye on your health
* High scores are determined by the number of coins you collect on level 3
  
To play the game just run the game file in eclipse
